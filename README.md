# AbstractNodeList

  This abstract class project defines items that can be stored in a tree.
  The class contains 2 references to items which will represent the next and previous items (in the case of a linked tree).
  I.e., if you call your abstract class ListItem, then it would have 2 member variables of type ListItem that will hold references to the next/right and previous/left ListItems.
